WRO2023-Teslars README
====

This repository represents a comprehensive overview of the engineering methods employed in the development of a self-driven car for participation in the World Robot Olympiad (WRO) 2023 competition, future engineers category. Each of the following folders contain detailed information about every method that is used to help us create an efficient and autonomous vehicle that is capable of completing the future engineers challenges in this competition.

1-	 Models:
This folder is a comprehensive collection of all parts used in the creation of our robot. It encompasses 3D printed parts that we designed, CNC machined components, laser cut plexi parts that are used as the base of our car to help fix the components, as well as off the shelf parts like motors, sensors and electronics. This folder serves as a repository for the diverse range of components that come together to form a fully functional self-driven car.

2-	Others:
This folder houses essential documents and flow charts that provide in-depth insights into the robot’s algorithm, steering methods, about the chosen DC motor, electronics power consumption, and pseudocode. These resources shed light on the decision-making process, steering mechanism rationale, power efficiency considerations, and the step-by-step algorithmic approach employed to ensure the vehicle’s successful completion of tasks. This folder is a valuable resource for understanding the technical aspects and strategic choices behind the development of the robot.

3-	Schemes: 
This folder is a collection of Bills of Materials (BOMs) and diagrams that outline the circuit and wiring of our robot. It provides detailed information on the components required for the electrical system, including sensors, controllers, and power supply. The BOMs list the specific parts needed, their quantities and specifications. The diagrams show the circuitry and wiring connections, allowing for clear understanding. This folder is for ensuring accurate assembly, troubleshooting, and maintenance of the robot’s electrical system.

4-	Src (source):
This folder comprises two subfolders. The first one contains the main code responsible for executing the tasks and ensuring the car’s autonomous functionality. This code encompasses various algorithms, control mechanisms, and decision-making processes that enable the vehicle to navigate and perform assigned tasks efficiently. The second folder contains the impu library, which we developed specifically for the IMU sensors. This library includes functions and classes that that facilitate accurate data collection and interpretation from the IMU sensor, aiding in precise motion tracking, orientation estimation, and sensor fusion.

5-	T-photos:
This directory contains photos of the team, an official photo and funny photos with all team members.

6-	V-photos:
This directory contains two folders, the first one contains the real photos of the robot from all the sides (top, bottom, back, front and 2 side views). 
The second folder contains the robot’s virtual photos that were taken from SolidWorks after completing the whole robot’s assembly and making sure thit it looks exactly like the real one.

7-	Video:
This directory contains the video.md file with a URL to YouTube  that is accessible by link showing the vehicle completing the tasks.
